        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place your red onion, green pepper, and tomato that have been cut into 4 into a blender with 1/4 cup of water.Blend till it forms a semi chunky liquid.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pot with water. Once water is simmering, add the mixture from the blender. Add cilantro stems.Add in your spices.</li>
            <li>Bring large pot to a boil and add in your yuca. </li>
            <li>Let the yuca boil unitl it is soft enough to stick a fork through.</li>
            <li>While the yuca is cooking, you'll be making the "salsa". Slice up your tomatos and onions. Place onions into a bowl with 2 tbs of salt and enough water to cover the onions. This is to remove some of that sour onion taste.</li>
            <li>Drain the onoions after about 5 minutes and mix with the sliced tomatoes. Finely chop your head of cilantro and add to the onions and tomatos.</li>
            <li>Squeeze about 4 limes into the "salsa". Add salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Once the yuca is ready, take it out of the pot and set aside into a bowl. Let it cool for a couple of minutes. Cut the yuca into bite sized pieces, removing the middle stem. </li>
            <li>Add the tuna and cook until its almost fully cooked</li>
            <li>Now, add the yuca. let that cook until the tuna is fully cooked ></li>
            <li>Once evrything is fully cooked. Serve in bowl with "salsa" on top.</li>
            <li>You can eat this soup with a side of rice, some chifles (thinly sliced plantains), toasted corn nuts, some pickled spicy vegetable, or some lemons. </li>
        </ol>
